# EAAA Booking Project

## Description
This is a booking project I created during my Web Development education. Originally, it was built using MySQL, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Since then, I have rebuilt it with Spring Boot and React, alongside HTML and CSS, as these technologies are more widely used and industry-standard.

The project was designed to address an issue at my school, where study rooms were frequently occupied without an efficient booking system. It allows users to book study rooms, ensuring effecient and organized access to these resources.


## Technologies
- Spring Boot
- React
- HTML
- CSS


## How to run
To run the project, ensure you have Docker installed. Use the following command:
``` 
docker compose up --build 
```
This command will build and start the project containers. Once complete, the application will be available for use on http://localhost:3000.
